All the data used for this project can be accessed from the [EPA Website](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html), which we will pull from directly in this notebook. This dataset contains geographical and time-series data on various factors that contribute to AQI from all government sites. The main goal at the end for you will be to understand how AQI varies both geographically and over time, and use your analysis (as well as other data that you can find) to be predict AQI at a certain point in time for various locations in California.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, you will be using other datasets to assist with analysis and predictions. Traditionally, to join dataframes we need to join on a specific column with shared values. However, when it comes to locations, exact latitudes and longitudes are hard to come by since it is a continuous space. First, lets look at such a dataset that we may want to merge on with `epa_data_CA_merged`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we have loaded in the `traffic_data` dataset, which contains traffic data for various locations in California. Your task is to clean this table so that it includes only the following columns (you may have to rename some): `District`, `Route`, `County`, `Descriptn`, `AADT`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, where `AADT` is found by taking the sum of the back and ahead `AADT`s (you may run into some issues with cleaning the data in order to add these columns - `.str` functions may help with this). The metric AADT, annual average daily traffic, is calculated as the sum of the traffic north of the route (ahead AADT) and south of the route (back AADT). You also need to make sure to clean and remove any illegal values from the dataframe (hint: check `Latitude` and `Longitude`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditionally, we could employ some sort of join where we join `epa_data_CA_merged` rows with the row in `traffic_data` that it is the \"closest\" to, as measured by euclidean distance. As you can imagine, this can be quite tedious so instead we will use a special type of join called a **spatial join**, which can be done using the package `geopandas`, which is imported as `gpd`. The documentation for `geopandas` is linked [here](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/api/geopandas.sjoin_nearest.html). Please use this as a resource to do the following tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    " - turn `traffic_data_cleaned` and `epa_data_CA_merged` into a geopandas dataframe using the latitude and longitude.\n",
    " - Use a spatial join (which function is this in the documentation?) to match the correct traffic row information to each entry in `epa_data_CA_merged`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your final dataframe should be assigned to `gpd_epa_traffic` with the following columns: `State Name`, `county Name`, `Month`, `Day`, `AQI`, `Category`, `Defining Site`, `Site Lat`, `Site Long`, `Traffic Lat`, `Traffic Long`, `Descriptn`, and `AADT`.\n",

Almost every summer/fall, all 3 of these states suffer catastrophic wildfire seasons that undoubtedly ruin the AQI due to ash, smoke, and other combusted organic material. Furthermore, these 3 states are also relatively extremely drought ridden, and suffer from lack of precipitation, which could also further contribute to worse AQIs.\n",

We can also see a slight gradient in air quality as we go south, which could be due to population and climate._\n"

Through the previous few questions we have discussed that wilfire data as well as temperature may be good indicators, but we can explitly look at correlations via the temperature to verify our hypothesis. Like temperature, there are other columns of data such as particulate matter, chemical concentrations, wind data, etc. Your open-ended EDA will be useful for filling in missing points in the heatmap that you created in question 4b. \n",

    "_Due to California's history of redlining and other racially discriminatory acts/policies, we wanted to look at how demography relates to AQI, focusing on BIPOC vs White populations' relationships to AQI. First we looked at the relationship between individual racial proportions and median AQI using lmplots. We can see a positive correlation between the proportion of Black or African Americans in the county versus AQI, whereas the proportion of Whites had a negative correlation with AQI. Asians and American Indian/Alaska Native do not seem to show any correlation with AQI._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_To compare the two groups with correlation against each other, we used a stacked bar plot where the Black proportion shows as green, the White proportion as orange, and the total AQI shows as blue. By comparing the 10 counties of the highest and lowest AQIs, we can see that the highest AQI counties have a greater proportion of Blacks or African Americans versus Whites than the lowest AQI counties._\n"

    "\n",
    "### Question 8 - Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, we will be using a simple interpolation to find the missing grid values for AQI on the heatmap visualization that you produced in part 1. Simple linear interpolation just takes the locations' values and averages them to produce an estimate of the current location. Though this is not as predictive (we are not predicting based on features about the location itself), it will give you a sense of the task at hand for the remainder of the project. \n",

    "As a reminder, the heatmap produced after running the cell below is the one you produced for question 6b when creating a visualization for the AQI in California for the month of september. It produces white spaces where there exist `NaN` values in the pivot table. "

    "### Question 8a - Simple Linear Interpolation\n",
    "As previously mentioned, interpolation is a technique that is used to predict labels in a dataset by forming a model out of the data that is already labelled. In this case, we have a pivot table that we use to create a heatmap, but there contains many `NaN` values that we want to fill in. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create the function `fill_bucket` that takes in the following parameters:\n",
    "    - `pivot_table`: the pivot table that we are providing. \n",
    "    - `lat_bucket`: the bucket number that the latitude is in, indexed by zero. ex. if there are 25 buckets, they are numbered $ 0, 2, \\dots 24 $, from lowest to highest value latitudes. \n",
    "    - `lon_bucket`: the bucket number that the longitude is in, indexed by zero. ex. if there are 25 buckets, they are numbered $ 0, 2, \\dots 24 $. from lowest to highest value longitudes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In the pivot table, every value has cells above (A cells), cells below (B cells), cells to the left (L cells), and cells to the right (R cells). We will say that a direction (R for example) is valid if and only if there exists a cell **anywhere** to its right that is not `NaN`. The closest such cell will be called the \"closest R cell\". The same goes for the rest of the directions. For the cases below, assuming that our current cell is called cell K. \n",
    "    - If cell K is not `NaN`, then simply return the AQI at that given cell.\n",
    "    - **Only** if there are **at least** three valid directional cells (ex. has A, B, and L valid but not R valid), we will call K *interpolable*. If K is *interpolable*, then interpolate K by assigning it an AQI value equal to the average of the closest cell AQIs in each of the valid directions. \n",
    "    - If K is *not interpolable*, then do not do anything and simply return `NaN`.\n",
    "- The return value of `fill_bucket` should be the the value assigned to K. **DO NOT** mutate the cell K in the pivot table yet.\n",

As such we can utilize the same method we used in 8a but take into account distance. For instance, if the NaN cell has a value above it (meaning that there are no additional empty spaces from the NaN cell to a non-NaN cell), we can use that value itself without scaling by any factor. However, if for that same NaN cell, there is a non-NaN value 4 spaces to the right, we can scale that value by 0.1 * number of NaN cells (or any other value to represent the distance), decreasing the weight of that cell on our interpolated value._"

For example, for a given $i$, let's say $x_i$ yields  $\\hat{y_i} =$ unhealthy for sensitive groups. If $y_i$ is $good$, the loss function would yield a greater loss for $\\hat{y_i} =$ $unhealthy for sensitive groups$ than if $y_i=$ $moderate$. The loss function would output 0 loss if $\\hat{y_i} = y_i$.

    "### Question 10: Creating your own Model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an idea of how to interpolate values, we will be using something more predictive. In this part, your final goal is to be creating a model and function that uses **at least four** features, with at least one of those four features being from an external dataset that you bring in and process yourself. Here are some rules on the model that you should follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using your open-ended EDA analysis, use at least three features in the dataset provided to come up with some sort of predictive model for the AQI for remaining locations not predicted in the heatmap. You are **NOT** allowed to use any more than **one** of the particulate matter features for this model i.e. ozone or CO2 concentrations for example. \n",
    "    - The reason behind this is that AQI is directly based on these values, so there will be in some sense a near 100\\% correlation between AQI and these features under some transformations. \n",
    "- Use at least one feature that comes from an external dataset of choice. Some examples are geographical region (categorical), elevation (quantitative), or wilfire data. \n",
    "    - Reference question 2c of this project to see how to merge external data with the current EPA data.\n",
    "- Your model should, at the end, predict one of the following broad categories for the AQI: good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous. Note that this specification is different from `fill_bucket` in the sense that instead of returning a value, you will be returning a string for a category.\n",
    "    - As a result, you can either directly predict the category, or the AQI (ex. through regression) and then convert to the category. Category ranges for AQI can be found online.\n",
    "- The final model should be validated with some data that you hold out. You decide how to do this but there should be some model validation accuracy reported. You should be using the loss function that you designed in question 3 in order to do this.\n",

    "**`features`**: This should be a `pd.DataFrame` object that represents the design matrix that will be fed in as input to your model. Each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature. Essentially your $X$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`targets`**: This should be a numpy array that where each value corresponds to the AQI value or AQI category for each of the data points in `features`. Essentially your $y$ vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`build_model`**: This function should have two parameters: `features` that will be used as input into your model as a `pd.DataFrame` object, and `targets` should be a numpy array of AQI values OR AQI categories. It should return a *function* or *object* that represents your model.\n",

(AADT comes from the included traffic dataset; Total population and Average Population Density from external dataset sourced from U.S. Census, the external dataset features are commented out for atuograder) I think that ozone level will be very predictive of the AQI category since air particulate matter is very correlated with AQI. Additionally, I think that population density will be fairly predictive of AQI category since higher density would correlate to higher use of resources such as gas for transportation. We also chose season as a feature because we believe that seasons like Summer and Spring are more prone to wildfires meaning that AQI during these time frames may be higher. As for latitude/longitude, we think it will be less predictive of AQI but we wanted to include it because it is a quantitative variable versus the categorical variable of region. Finally, we think that elevation will be fairly predictive of AQI category since elevation may be related with other variables like wind speed (which affects AQI)._\n",

Then we will utilize a feature function to create a design matrix from the training set by utilizing OHE/dummies for categorical variables and standardizing numerical variables appropriately. Once we create a design matrix, we will utilize our build_model function to create a model and fit our model to our training data (design matrix and targets). Then we will test our model by first predicting AQI using our test-data as an input into our model fitted on training data and utilizing the loss function that we described above to determine whether our model is effective._\n"

    "_Our baseline model is a multiple linear regression model trained on three features, Ozone Level PPM per County, Region and Number of Very Unhealthy Days to predict the median AQI of counties in California. \"Region\" is from an external dataset and gives U.S. Census classifications of California counties into regions, and the \"Number of Very Unhealthy Days\" comes from the initial AQI data and refers to the number of very unhealthy air quality days measured in that county during the year 2020. We used a 30/70 train-test split. Our model has pretty low variation, with an RMSE of 5.7627 (around 8.865% of the range of our data) and a rather high correlation coefficient R2 of 0.8839 (from the random seed we used for analysis). We used a k-fold cross validation of k=5 and received a low cross-validation R2 score of 0.2933. To improve our model, we want to make a couple adjustments. First, we want to make our model more complex and include demographic data, specifically looking at race. A nonzero correlation between race and AQI level would theoretically improve our model's predictive power, and we want to examine to what degree as well as the optimal number of racial demographics to include. We can also use this to support our hypothesis that the density of the African-American population in a geographic region is a predictor for the region's AQI. However, we are wary of overfitting, so in adding in more and more racial data, we want to watch out for a point where error begins to rise._"

    "Improve your model from part 11a based on the improvements that you suggested in part 11b. This could be the addition of more features, performing additional transformations on your features, increasing/decreasing the complexity of the model itself, or really anything else. You have no limitation on the number of features you can use, but you are required to use at least **one external dataset** that you process and merge in yourself. \n",

    "_Our baseline model was a multiple linear regression model on two features, Region and the Number of Very Unhealthy Days (annual, based on air quality) in a region. Our improved model includes the African-American population density of each region as a fourth feature. Our correlation coefficient R2 of our new model was slightly higher than the baseline (0.8872 vs 0.8839) and our RMSE was slightly lower (5.6810 vs 5.7627), but our cross-validation R2 nearly doubled from 0.2933 in our baseline model to 0.5128 in our new model. We constructed multiple models in our analysis, each one adding in more racial data (first African-American, then White, then American-Indian). We settled on the model that had Median Ozone PPM, Region, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, and Black Proportion as features because our hypothesis pertains specifically to the predictive power of African-American population proportion. Additionally, due to the immense improvement in cross validation score, we fail to reject our hypothesis that African Americans have some predictive power in estimating AQI. However, it is important to note that while adding in only African-American population data improved our model across the board, RMSE began to rise with the addition of other racial demographic data. We believe this is because the addition of those factors caused overfitting in our model. Additionally, we have to be wary about our conclusion as we only utilized a total of 53 counties/data points, which means that our 70/30 train-test split led to a trade-off between test RMSE and R2 versus cross validation RMSE and R2._\n"
